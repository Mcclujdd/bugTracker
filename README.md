# Bug Tracker

Bug Tracker is a web based interface for tracking bugs in software projects in an extremely simple, yet effective, way.

## Installation
The intention of this site is not to be hosted externally at this stage.

I test and use localhost on my machines.

In order to run with database functionality, one can use the following:
 - PHP (for database integration)
 - MySQL Server (for database hosting)
 - Apache Server (for hosting site)

## Usage
```
The Dashboard allows access to your bugs at a glance and gives you easy manipulation options like add, squash (equivalent to archiving), export(pull data to a csv or pdf), and edit.
```

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
